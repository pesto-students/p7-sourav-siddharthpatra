A web browser is basically a tool/software that helps us to browse the internet. Basically it gives the access to get opened to the world. So a web browser works in a way to get the data from all over the web/internet and format it and then display to the user. The data basically travels through HTTP protocols and a web browser interprests these data and helps us to retrieve information. So the browser is able to do all these things due to the different components that a browser has. All these components make the browser work efficiently and give the data/information as expected. So the major components of a browser are -: 

1. UI - user Interface is the most important part of the web browser as it contains the essential parts i.e the back/forward button, address bar, menu, etc.
2. Browser Engine - It acts as a middle man between UI and the rendering engine.
3. Render Engine - The rendering engine does all the action in displaying the requested content.
4. Networking - The networking tells about the different protocols behind the the platform-independent interface.
5. UI Backend - The backend uses O.S interfaces so that the browser becomes platform independent.
6. JavaScript interpreter - This helps browser to execute JavaScript code.
7. Data Storage - This helps browser to save cache or sesion data or some local data which may help browser to save some time in next renders.

The tree construction in a browser happens with tokens from the tokenization system where the DOCTYPE, start tag, endtag and all other identifers are presnet and then the DOM construction starts with the DOM object from the parser and then followed by the HTMl ending and closing tags and head and body atgs where all the nodes are attached to the body tag.

Then when the browser encounters with any script tag then browser pauses all the other actions to download the script and once it is downloaded the rest of the tasks proceeds. If the HTML is paused then again it starts rendering.
